   * Tracker for new effects added within a given render transaction. This is
   * used to coordinate adding effects to the queue. In a given render pass, all
   * effects added should be added in the order they were received, but they
   * should be _prepended_ to any pre-existing effects. For instance, let's say
   * that the queue started off in this state after our first render pass:
   *
   *   A, B, C
   *
   * On the next render pass, we add D and E, which are siblings, and children
   * of A. The timing semantics of effects is that siblings should be
   * initialized in the order they were defined in, and should run before
   * parents. So, assuming D comes before E, we want to do:
   *
   *   D, E, A, B, C
   *
   * This way, new children will always run in the correct order, and before
   * their parents. By keeping track of the new effects during a given
   * transaction in a separate array, we can then efficiently add them to the
   * beginning of the overall effect queue at the end, and preserve the proper
   * order.
